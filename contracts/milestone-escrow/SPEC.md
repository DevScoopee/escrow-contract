# Milestone Escrow: State Machine Specification

This document is the reference for every state transition in
`contracts/milestone-escrow/src/lib.rs`: which milestone and escrow-level states
exist, which entry point moves between them, who must sign, what tokens move and
which event is published.

PRs that add, remove or change a transition must update this file (see
`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Actors

| Actor | Set by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `__constructor`, `transfer_admin`, `execute_admin_transfer` | Platform operator. Controls overrides, pauses, fees, yield, whitelist and upgrades. |
| Client | `__constructor` | Funds the job and approves milestones. |
| Freelancer | `__constructor` | Delivers milestones and receives payouts. |
| Arbiter | `__constructor` | Resolves disputed milestones. |
| Multisig signer | `multisig_approval_init` | Approves proposal IDs (used by `execute_admin_transfer`). |
| Anyone | n/a | May call read-only and calculation endpoints, and `execute_admin_transfer` once it is approved. |

## Milestone states

`MilestoneStatus` has seven values:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Pending` | Created by `__constructor`; not yet delivered. |
| `Delivered` | Freelancer marked it delivered; the auto-release window is running. |
| `PartiallyReleased` | Client released part of the amount with `approve_partial`. |
| `Disputed` | Frozen for arbitration. |
| `Released` | Fully paid to the freelancer. Terminal. |
| `Refunded` | Remaining amount returned to the client. Terminal. |
| `Split` | Remaining amount divided between client and freelancer by an arbitration or streaming split. |

### Normal workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: __constructor
    Pending --> Delivered: mark_delivered
    Delivered --> Released: approve_milestone, claim_auto_release, approve_partial (full)
    Delivered --> PartiallyReleased: approve_partial
    PartiallyReleased --> PartiallyReleased: approve_partial
    PartiallyReleased --> Released: approve_partial (rest)
    Pending --> Disputed: raise_dispute
    Delivered --> Disputed: raise_dispute
    PartiallyReleased --> Disputed: raise_dispute
    Disputed --> Released: resolve_dispute (release), split with no client share
    Disputed --> Refunded: resolve_dispute (refund), split with no freelancer share
    Disputed --> Split: apply_dispute_arbitration_split, admin_override_streaming_release
    Released --> [*]
    Refunded --> [*]
```

### Admin override transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Any status except Released or Refunded" as Open
    Open --> Released: admin_override_release, multisig_admin_override_release, admin_override_tax_release, admin_override_cancel_release
    Open --> Refunded: admin_override_refund, multisig_admin_override_refund, admin_override_tax_refund, admin_override_cancel_refund
    Open --> Released: admin_override_tax_split_refund (freelancer share > 0)
    Open --> Refunded: admin_override_tax_split_refund (freelancer share = 0)
```

## Escrow-level states

These are independent flags stored in instance storage, not mutually exclusive
states.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Unfunded" as Unfunded
    state "Funded" as Funded
    [*] --> Unfunded: __constructor
    Unfunded --> Funded: fund

    state "Accepted" as Accepted
    Funded --> Accepted: accept_job and accept_arbiter
    Funded --> Refunded: withdraw_unaccepted (window passed)

    state "Emergency paused (Ep)" as EP
    Funded --> EP: emergency_pause
    EP --> Funded: emergency_unpause, emergency_pause_admin_override

    state "Admin paused (Paused)" as AP
    Funded --> AP: admin_pause_escrow
    AP --> Funded: admin_resume_escrow

    state "Cancel locked (CancelLock)" as CL
    Funded --> CL: cancel_escrow (second party)
    CL --> Funded: admin_override_cancel_release, admin_override_cancel_refund

    state "Multisig locked (MultisigLocked)" as ML
    Funded --> ML: multisig_lock
    ML --> Funded: multisig_admin_override_release, multisig_admin_override_refund
```

| Flag | Key | Set by | Cleared by | Checked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Funded | `JobMeta.funded`, `DataKey::FundedAt` | `fund` | never | most settlement entry points (`NotFunded`) |
| Acceptance | `DataKey::Acceptance` (bit 1 freelancer, bit 2 arbiter) | `accept_job`, `accept_arbiter` | never | `mark_delivered`, `raise_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`, `apply_dispute_arbitration_split` (`NotAccepted`), `withdraw_unaccepted` |
| Emergency pause | `DataKey::Ep` | `emergency_pause`, `emergency_pause_admin_override` | `emergency_unpause`, `emergency_pause_admin_override` | `ensure_not_paused` and the calculators listed below |
| Admin pause | `DataKey::Paused` | `admin_pause_escrow` | `admin_resume_escrow` | `ensure_not_paused`, `assert_not_paused` |
| Cancel approval | `DataKey::CancelApproval` | `cancel_escrow` (first party) | `revoke_cancel_approval`, `cancel_escrow` (second party) | `cancel_escrow`, `revoke_cancel_approval` |
| Cancel lock | `DataKey::CancelLock` | `cancel_escrow` (second party) | `admin_override_cancel_release`, `admin_override_cancel_refund` | `ensure_not_paused` |
| Multisig lock | `DataKey::MultisigLocked` | `multisig_lock` | `multisig_admin_override_release`, `multisig_admin_override_refund` | the multisig override and split endpoints |
| Tax record | `DataKey::TaxWithholdingLock(i)` | `tax_withholding_deductions` | `admin_override_tax_release`, `admin_override_tax_refund`, `admin_override_tax_split_refund` | the tax override endpoints |
| Owed balance | `DataKey::Owed(address)`, `DataKey::TotalOwed` | any payout whose transfer fails | `withdraw` | `withdraw`, settlement balance caps |

`ensure_not_paused` rejects with `Paused` while `Ep` or the admin `Paused` flag is set and with
`EscrowLocked` while `CancelLock` is set. `assert_not_paused` rejects with
`Paused` while the admin `Paused` flag is set.

## Payouts

Every payout from the contract to the client or freelancer goes through
`pay_or_credit`: the tokens are pushed to the recipient, and if that transfer
fails (for example a classic asset whose recipient has no trustline) the amount
is credited to `DataKey::Owed(recipient)` instead, so the settlement still
completes. The recipient claims credited amounts with `withdraw`. In the tables
below `→ freelancer` and `→ client` mean a payout made this way.

## State-changing entry points

Columns: required signer(s), guards checked before the transition, allowed
source milestone status, resulting status, token movement and published event
topic.

| Entry point | Signer(s) | Guards | Event |

| `split_refund_net_distribution` | none | not paused | `sprefnet` |
| `calculate_platform_fee_split` | none | allocation initialised | `pf_split` |

| `interest_yield_split_refund` | none | not paused; yield state unlocked | `iyspltref` |
| `tax_withholding_split_refund` | none | valid inputs | `twspltref` |
| `cancel_escrow_split_refund` | none | `ensure_not_paused`; `assert_not_paused` | `cxlspref` |
| `cancel_escrow_claim_refund` | admin | `CancelLock` set | `cxlspref` |
| `multisig_split_refund` | admin | `MultisigLocked` set | `splitref` |
| `multisig_transfer_admin` | admin | valid ratios | `msigtrx` |
| `admin_tax_withholding_deductions` | admin | funded | `taxwh` |
| `emergency_pause_split_refund` | client, freelancer or admin | emergency paused | `epspltref` |
| `emergency_pause_claim_refund` | admin | emergency paused | `emergency_pause_claim_refund` |
| `emergency_pause_allocation` | client, freelancer or admin | emergency paused | `epalloc` |
| `payment_streaming_milestones` | contract, client and freelancer | not paused | `p_stream` |
| `payment_streaming_consent` | client and freelancer | not paused | `p_strcns` |
| `milestone_time_extensions` | contract, client and freelancer | none | `m_ext` |
| `time_extensions_consent` | client and freelancer | not paused | `m_extcns` |

## Invariants

1. **Conservation.** For every milestone, the amount paid to the freelancer plus
   the amount refunded to the client must not exceed `amount`, and the contract
   must only pay out what it received in `fund`. Owed balances stay inside the
   contract and are excluded from the available balance used by settlement
   caps, so they are always backed.
2. **Terminal states are final.** No entry point accepts `Released` or
   `Refunded` as a source status.
3. **Delivery precedes approval.** `approve_milestone` and `claim_auto_release`
   require `Delivered`; `approve_partial` requires `Delivered` or
   `PartiallyReleased`.
4. **Parties consent before work starts.** Delivery and dispute endpoints
   require that both the freelancer (`accept_job`) and the arbiter
   (`accept_arbiter`) accepted the job; otherwise the client can reclaim the
   escrow with `withdraw_unaccepted` once the acceptance window has passed.
5. **Disputes are resolved only by the arbiter or the admin.** A `Disputed`
   milestone is moved only by `resolve_dispute`, `apply_dispute_arbitration_split`
   (arbiter) or the admin override endpoints.
6. **Who can move funds while paused.**
   - While emergency paused (`Ep`) or cancel locked, every endpoint guarded by
     `ensure_not_paused` is rejected: `fund`, `mark_delivered`,
     `approve_partial`, `approve_milestone`, `claim_auto_release`,
     `raise_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`, `apply_dispute_arbitration_split` and
     `upgrade`. The admin override endpoints do not check `Ep`, so only the
     admin can move funds.
   - While admin paused (`Paused`), `admin_override_refund` and
     `extend_milestone_deadline` are rejected.
   - `withdraw` is not gated by any pause, so owed balances can always be
     claimed.

## Read-only endpoints

These neither change state nor publish events: `get_job`, `get_reputation`,
`version`, `is_token_whitelisted`, `get_whitelisted_tokens`,
`time_until_auto_release`, `dispute_arbitration_split`, `is_emergency_paused`,
`get_platform_fee_allocation`, `is_multisig_approved`,
`get_pending_admin_transfer`, `is_escrow_interest_yield_locked`,
`get_escrow_interest_yield`, `get_yield_info`, `is_multisig_locked`.
